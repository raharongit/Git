    <h1>6. How to see the history</h1>
        <p><code>git log</code></p>

        <h1>7. More information of history</h1>
        <p><code>git log --summary</code></p>
        <p>To see more information for each commit. We can see where new files were added for the first time OR where files were deleted.</p>
        <p>It's good overview of what's going on the project.</p>

            <h1>8. Remote Repo</h1>
            <p>Go to Github website and create a new empty repository.</p>
            <p>To push our local repository to the Github server, we'll need to add a remote repository.</p>
            <p><code>git remote add remotename repo_url</code></p>
            <p>Here remotename is a nickname of this project so generally we call it <span>origin</span> OR it's depend on you whatever you want to call it. Git doesn't care what you name your remotes, but it's typical to name your main one origin.</p>
            <p>repo_url is the url of your new empty repository on Github.</p>

    <section>
        <h1>9. Pushing Remotely</h1>
        <p><code>git push -u remotename master</code></p>
        <p>The push command tells git where to put our commits when we're ready.</p>
        <p>We are pushing our local changes to our repository on Github.</p>
        <p>Default local branch name is master.</p>
        <p><span>-u</span> tells git to remember the parameters, so that next time we can simply run <code>git push</code> and git woll know what to do.</p>
