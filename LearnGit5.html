        <p><b>Merge Conflicts:-</b> Merge conflicts can occur when changes are made to a file at the same time.</p>
        <p>A lot of people get really scared when a conflict happens, but fear not!</p>
        <p>They are not scary! You just need to decide which code to keep.</p>
        <p>Merge conflicts are beyond the scope of this course. May be i'll put them later. So don't worry about them.</p>

    <p>If you want to delete a branch then follow this command:-</p>
    <code>git branch -d branch_name</code>
    <h2>Some Important Things</h2>
    <p>What if you've been working on a feature branch &amp; you decide you really don't want this branch anymore?</p>
    <p>You might decide to delete the branch since you're scrapping the idea.</p>
    <p>You'll notice that <code>git branch -d branch_name</code> doesn't work.</p>
    <p>This is because <code>-d</code> won't let you delete something that hasn't been merged.</p>
    <p>You can either add the (--force) or (-f) option or use (-D). Which combines (-d -f) together into one command.</p>
  <p>So now we can push this project through this command:-</p>
    <code>git push</code>
